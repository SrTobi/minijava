// This file defines the micro-benchmarks.  It consists of a single JSON object
// with one attribute per benchmark.  The key is the name of the benchmark and
// the value is its definition.  The definition is itself a JSON object that
// may have the following attributes.
//
//  - `description` (optional) -- a short description of the benchmark
//  - `command` (mandatory) -- command-line to execute the benchmark
//
// The `command` attribute must have as value an array of strings.  The first
// element in that array is the file-name of the executable and the remaining
// elements are passed to it as command-line argumetns.
//
// The command must produce on standard output the following message
//
//     <mean> <stdev> <n>
//
// which will be consumed by the driver script.  The standard error and
// standard input streams are connected to `/dev/null`.
//
// As you will probably have guessed by now, you can -- as an extension to the
// official JSON format -- also use comments in this file.  This functionality
// is rather limited, however.  Only line-comments that are on a line of their
// own are allowed.  Everything else is still a syntax error.
